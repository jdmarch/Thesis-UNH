% Handling of the appendices (if any) - Alexander Vapirev, July 2007
% If you don't have appendix then comment all these lines.
% Added \usepackage{appendix} in bookdefs
% Better handling of appendices here. Then each appendix is just as another chapter.
% If there is ONLY one appendix then you must not assign letter to it.
